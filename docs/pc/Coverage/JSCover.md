### JSCover - A JavaScript code coverage measurement tool.

JSCover is an easy-to-use JavaScript code coverage measuring tool. It is an enhanced version of the popular JSCoverage tool, having added several features including branch coverage, LCOV and Cobertura XML reports for CI integration, hooks for automated tests and HTML Local Storage to maintain coverage data without the use of iFrames or JavaScript opened windows.

It's distinguishing factor from other JavaScript coverage tools is that it easily runs in any browser (supporting JavaScript) allowing coverage measurement of tests that include DOM interaction. It can be run with most tools (e.g. Jasmine, QUnit, Mocha, etc...).
