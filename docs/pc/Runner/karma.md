### karama

A simple tool that allows you to execute JavaScript code in multiple real browsers.

>The main purpose of Karma is to make your test-driven development easy, fast, and fun.


### When should I use Karma?

* You want to test code in real browsers.
* You want to test code in multiple browsers (desktop, mobile, tablets, etc.).
* You want to execute your tests locally during development.
* You want to execute your tests on a continuous integration server.
* You want to execute your tests on every save.
* You love your terminal.
* You don't want your (testing) life to suck.
* You want to use Istanbul to automagically generate coverage reports.
* You want to use RequireJS for your source files.


### But I still want to use _insert testing library_

Karma is not a testing framework, nor an assertion library. Karma just launches a HTTP server, and generates the test runner HTML file you probably already know from your favourite testing framework. So for testing purposes you can use pretty much anything you like. There are already plugins for most of the common testing frameworks:

* Jasmine
* Mocha
* QUnit
* and many others
