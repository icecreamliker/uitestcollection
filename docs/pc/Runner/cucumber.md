### What is cucumber?

Cucumber is a tool that supports Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) - a software development process that aims to enhance software quality and reduce maintenance costs.

Cucumber executes executable specifications written in plain language and produces reports indicating whether the software behaves according to the specification or not.

Cucumber reduces the effort to keep requirements specifications, tests and documentation in sync - with Cucumber they are all the same documents - a single source of truth for everyone on the team.

Cucumber is compatible with all the major software platforms.
