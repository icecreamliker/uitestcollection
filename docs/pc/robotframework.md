Introduction
------------

`Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org>` is a generic open source test
automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven
development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes
the keyword-driven testing approach. Its testing capabilities can be extended
by test libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create
new higher-level keywords from existing ones using the same syntax that is used
for creating test cases.

Robot Framework is operating system and application independent. The core
framework is implemented using `Python <http://python.org>`, supports both
Python 2 and Python 3, and runs also on `Jython <http://jython.org>` (JVM)
and `IronPython <http://ironpython.net>` (.NET). The framework has a rich
ecosystem around it consisting of various generic test libraries and tools
that are developed as separate projects. For more information about Robot
Framework and the ecosystem, see http://robotframework.org.

Robot Framework project is hosted on GitHub where you can find source code,
an issue tracker, and some further documentation. See `<CONTRIBUTING.rst>`
if you are interested to contribute. Downloads are hosted on PyPI, except
for the standalone JAR distribution that is on `Maven central`.
