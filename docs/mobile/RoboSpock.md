### What is RoboSpock?
RoboSpock is an Android testing framework which brings Spockframework (modern groovy test framework) to Android applications. It lets you running blazing fast unit tests on JVM without any need for starting an emulator or making any deployments. We came with idea of making two things into one (Robolectric and Spock).

* RoboSpock glues several frameworks together and enables you to work with them directly.
* Enjoy the support for Spock framework, Groovy language and RoboGuice

### You can

* Unit test Android code with Spock and Groovy
* Write readable specifications
* Execute tests fast on JVM
* Mock your objects and test interactions
* Specify behavior of Android SDK classes
