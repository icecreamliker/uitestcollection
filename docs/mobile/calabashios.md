### What is calabash?

Calabash is an automated testing technology for Android and iOS native and hybrid applications. This repository contains support for Android, for iOS.

Calabash enables you to write and execute automated acceptance tests of mobile  apps.It's cross-platform,supporting Android and IOS native apps.It's also open source and free,developed and maintained by Xamarin.

### Xamarin Test Cloud
While Calabash is completely free, Xamarin, the company that developed and maintains Calabash, provides a number of commercial products and services centered around Calabash and quality assurance for mobile.

Xamarin Test Cloud is a cloud-based mobile testing lab which lets you execute Calabash tests on over 1,000 real mobile devices in the cloud. Write your own tests, or have Xamarin engineers create and maintain a test suite for you.

Calabash helps automate and test any iOS or Android app, native or hybrid, from the UI level down. Xamarin provides both the automation framework as well as the device cloud, so you can enjoy perfect integration and continuous improvements to Calabash in response to customer needs.

With Xamarin Test Cloud, you can select devices based on form factor, manufacturer, operating system, or even popularity in your target market. We’re adding over 100 devices every month, and if there’s a specific device you need, we’re taking requests.

### Calabash
Calabash supports Cucumber. Cucumber lets you express the behavior of your app using natural language that can be understood by business experts and non-technical QA staff.

Although we focus on Cucumber, Calabash can be used to write automated functional and acceptance tests using any Ruby-based test framework.
