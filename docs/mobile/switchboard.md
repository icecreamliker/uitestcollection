### What is Switchboard?
Switchboard - easy and super light weight A/B testing for your mobile iPhone or android app. This mobile A/B testing framework allows you with minimal servers to run large amounts of mobile users.

### What it does?

Switchboard is a simple way to remote control your mobile application even after you shipped it to your users' devices. Use switchboard to

1. Stage-rollout new features to users
2. A/B-test user flows, messaging, colors, features
3. anything you want to remote-control    

Switchboard lets you control what happens in your app. Quick, easy, useful.

Switchboard segments your users consistently. Because user segmentation is based only on UUID that is computed once, the experience you switch on and off using Switchboard is consistent across sessions.

### What it does not do (what you have to do yourself)

Switchboard does not give you analytics, nor does it automatic administration and optimization of your A/B tests. It also doesn't give you nice graphs and stuff. You can get all of that by plugging an analytics package into your app which you're probably doing anyway.

### Features

* Consistent user segmentation based on device ID
* Define experiments for specific application versions, OS version, language settings and more
* Comes with build in configuration for production and staging environment
* Highly scalable
* Safe when device is offline
* Flexible custom parameters for experiments

### What Switchboard was designed for

Switchboard was design as a super light weight and very flexible mobile A/B testing framework.
